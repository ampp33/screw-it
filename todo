- clean up REST code and objects to use better attr names
- make switch page pretty
- add EDIT page that submits values back to the REST service
- EDIT rest service (POST?) that takes values, compares against the
  current data, then only updates which fields have changed (use version numbers)
- update database to have a value_latest table that has a list of all the current
  fields for each switch, and when updates occur the old fields get pushed to
	another new table values_history.  Should also keep track of which user
	provided the value for each field and when.
- add database table for references that links back to a field and its specific
  version.
- update CREATE and EDIT pages to store references
- figure out how to version references (if at all), or should I use the same
  table setup as values?
- allow users to create accounts, login, and logout
- allow users to use google to login (expand to facebook, twitter, and apple in the future?)
- add legend to sliders
- add description field to switch page
